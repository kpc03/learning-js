// undefined - undefined is one the primitive data type or you can also call it a reserved keyword which is being used by JS engine whenever a variable is first initialised in execution context in phase 1. It also means that the variable is having some space in memory of execution context.

// not defined - no memory has been allocated and the variable is called. Its an error.

// JS is loosely typed language which means it doesn't specify any avriablee to its data type. Above small code is the example of that where a is assigned multiple data type values and this is valid javascript.

// a = undefined - never assign undefines to any variable as its not a good practice.
