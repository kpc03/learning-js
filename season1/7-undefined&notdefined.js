// undefined - undefined is one of the primitive data type or you can also call it a reserved keyword which is being used by JS engine whenever a variable is first initialised in execution context in phase 1. It also means that the variable is having some space in memory of execution context.

// not defined - no memory has been allocated and the variable is called. Its an error.

// JS is loosely typed language which means it doesn't specify any variablee to its data type. Small code above is the example of that where 'a' is assigned multiple values of different data type and this is valid javascript.

// a = undefined - never assign undefined to any variable as its not a good practice.
